# Image Compression Plugin for WordPress

This WordPress plugin allows users to compress images on the front-end of your website, which can improve page speed and reduce server load. With this plugin, visitors can upload images in JPG, PNG, or WebP format and set the compression level to their preference using a simple form.

The plugin uses the GD library to compress images, and it includes a ZIP archive function that enables users to download multiple compressed images at once. The plugin is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a simple shortcode that you can add to any page or post.

To get started with using this plugin, simply install and activate it in your WordPress dashboard. You can then add the [ic_compression_form] shortcode to any page or post where you want the compression form to appear.
