# Lossy Image Compression Plugin for WordPress

This WordPress plugin allows users to lossy compress images on the front-end of your website, which can improve page speed and reduce server load. With this plugin, visitors can upload images in JPG, PNG, or WebP format and set the compression level to their preference using a simple form.

To get started with using this plugin, simply install and activate it in your WordPress dashboard. You can then add the [ic_compression_form] shortcode to any page or post where you want the compression form to appear.

Planned for future updates - You are welcome to help!

- Allow multiple files to be uploaded (this worked in isolation)
- Allow multiple files to then be downloaded
- Add an area to drag and drop images in like TinyPNG
- Add a sceton to display and download the compresses images
- Retain the filename of the images once downloaded
- Upload and compress more images for free than TinyPNG
